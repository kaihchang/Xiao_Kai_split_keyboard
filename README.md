[still in design process]

After using my previous Ascend design for weeks, I decided that MX switches are too "big" (height is okay) and wanted a Choc kb that's different from my old Ferris Sweep.
This time I'd like to give Xiao BLE a try and my experience with Oled displays wasn't great (power-drawing and not really useful except for debugging), neither was a fan for splays (occupies space without really adding much to the "ergonomics"), so this time I'll go with a Sweep-ish variation with spreads that is customised for my hands.
Honestly encoders aren't really necessary since for me they're only useful for volume and bluetooth channel adjustments, but I've got 2 pins left and between encoder and TRRS socket for QMK to work, I chose former.
